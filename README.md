## Project Description

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that helps online food delivery companies identify customers who are likely to order food again. By analyzing customer data and training a machine learning model, we aim to predict customer behavior and improve delivery services accordingly.

The project involves the following steps:
- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Feature engineering and transformation
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Training a random forest classifier
- Evaluating the model's performance
- Using the trained model to make predictions for new customer data
