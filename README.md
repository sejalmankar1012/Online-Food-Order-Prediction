## Project Description

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that helps online food delivery companies identify customers who are likely to order food again. By analyzing customer data and training a machine learning model, we aim to predict customer behavior and improve delivery services accordingly.

The project involves the following steps:
- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Feature engineering and transformation
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Training a random forest classifier
- Evaluating the model's performance
- Using the trained model to make predictions for new customer data

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/sejalmankar1012/online-food-order-prediction.git

 
 1. Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset:

Ensure your dataset is in CSV format.
Make sure your dataset contains the required columns: Age, Gender, Marital Status, Occupation, Monthly Income, Educational Qualifications, Family size, Pin code, Feedback, and Output.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
 $ jupyter notebook
```

3. Open the Online_Food_Order_Prediction.ipynb notebook and follow the instructions to load and preprocess your dataset, train the model, and make predictions.
